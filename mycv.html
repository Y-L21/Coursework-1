<h2>Work Experience:</h2>
<h3>Hollister</h3>
<small>September 2021 - April 2022</small>
<p>I was a Brand representative and was tasked with completing various tasks such as maintaining a presentable and clean work environment creating easier shopping for our customers and a better work flow for the team, working on tills to process payments, refunds, online orders and membership enquiries, and using my interpersonal skills to converse with customers with a positive attitude to help them with their shopping, make them more comfortable in visiting not just the Hollister I worked in but all creating long lasting loyal customers. Since the Hollister I worked in was based in Regent Street I am used to an extremely fast paced environment (ability to work in a rapid moving environment), I am used to aiding customers that may not speak the local language or have difficulty expressing what theyâ€™re looking for as Regent Street is tourist dominated. I have also improved on my marketing skills at Hollister by being able to advertise sales we had going on and exclusive discounts that were only available to customers that were part of the membership scheme, enticing them to join.</p>
<h3>Google</h3>
<small>June 2021 - July 2021</small>
<p>I had a 5-day work experience placement with Google. Over the 5 days, I was assorted into a group to work on a project which was to design a Google store in King's Cross as there is yet to be one in London. I also had some workshops such as:<br>
    <ol>
        <li>Creative brainstorming masterclass</li>
        <li>Building your personal brand online</li>
        <li>Confidence building & virtual presentation tips.</li>
