  <a id="Philippines"><h1>Philippines</h1></a>
    <p>I have only been to the Philippines twice in my life. Once when I was a toddler (shouldn't count to be honest) and in 2018. I'll talk about the 2018 trip as it's the only one I actually remember. Me and my entire family visited the Philippines for 2-weeks to surprise my grandmother for her birthday (she hadn't seen us in person in years and is too old to travel). We first stopped at Manila the capital of the Philippines to visit a couple of my family members and explore the malls and tourist spots. After that, we flew over to my grandmother's island (Negros Oriental), if you haven't realised already, travelling to the Philippines is <b>extremely</b> expensive. Once we arrived one of my uncles picked us up from the airport and drove us to my grandmother's house in Tanjay. When we arrived at her place I was taken back by how beautiful the area was and how big her house was (living in London really makes you appreciate the sizes of houses) and the fact she had an <b>entire</b> Basketball court in the driveway. The first time I saw her she was washing a pig (foreshadowing) with a hose, we surprised her, hugged and ate a lot of food after (grandmothers love filling up their grandchildren's bellies). We spent the majority of our time at my grandmothers place but also explored different parts of the island and another island called Cebu. At Cebu we went to a sand-bar and swam with some whale sharks (I know, I am very brave). Overall, me and my family had an amazing time in the Philippines, definitely want to go again some day to see my family again and when we have enough money.</p>

<section class="France-section">
  <a id="France"><h1>France</h1></a>
    <p>I had a school trip in year 6 to France (was meant to go in year 11 too but it got cancelled due to Covid-19). I was there for a week and got their via coach and a cruise ship. I spent most of my time in some boarding like school place (I know I'm not that great at describing stuff) that had lots of outdoor activities. It was really fun doing the outdoor activities, living with my friends for a couple days, learning the language and trying new things but my favourite part by far was the Mont Saint Michel castle. It looked so cool, kind of like Hogwarts (I'm a Harry Potter fan if you can't tell) and the fact that you could only visit when the tide was low <abbr title="If I remember correctly">IIRC</abbr>. I also visited a chocolate factory which was cool but the chocolate was really expensive. I know I included a picture of the Eiffel Tower but I never visited it, maybe one day though. Anyways, if you have ever thought about visiting France I 10000000% recommend visiting the castle, it's truely something special.</p>

<!--Isle of Wight Section-->

<section class="Isle-of-wight-section">
  <a id="Isle-of-wight"><h1>Isle of Wight</h1></a>
    <p>I had a school trip to the Isle of Wight in year 4. It was the first trip I ever had away from my family so I was very excited and of course my mum was very worried (I think she thought I was going to cry everyday I wasn't with her, but I was a big boy). I was there for a week just like the France trip in the same kind of area. Did a whole bunch of outdoor/indoor activties with quadbiking being my favourite. I also enjoyed archery near the end of my stay (made me feel like green arrow), but it's much harder than it looks and hurts a lot if you pull the string the wrong direction. Overall, Isle of Wight is a good trip to have if you want to stay in the UK but get away from the city life (that's if you go to the woodland areas like I did).</p>
